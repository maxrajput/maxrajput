To make learning SQL easier, I built a **Discord bot called SQL Mentor**. It has **400+ real-time SQL interview questions** that let users practice by topic, company, or difficulty level. Iâ€™ve also conducted **live workshops** for **2,000+ professionals**, teaching them SQL and other essential data skills to boost their careers.

Iâ€™m skilled in tools like **AWS, Linux, Python, PostgreSQL, Tableau, Power BI, and Excel**. In my previous role as a **Senior Analyst at Dell Technologies**, I used data to make better decisions, improve customer experiences, and optimize workflows.
